# PEBBLE_WE_HAVE_A_PROBLEM / What's UP? :: Pebble Watchapp


## Intended purpose:
  * Tells you info about what's up (ISS, weather, astronomical events and objects). 
  * Hopefully, once finished, this app could be a useful tool for astronomy enthusiasts to: 
      - get info about the ISS
      - know if the sky will be clear and know what kind of weather to expect in a night of observation
      - know what kind of astronomical events or objects he/she could watch tonight

### Features:

  * undecided name^
  * currently tells you info about 
      - the ISS's current location, current crew, and its next pass over your location
      - weather info

### Will be implemented (once NASA's API is no longer a WIP):
  * list of astronomical objects and events observable from your location 

### TODO:
  * get reverse geocoding working so we can get a physical address of the coordinates the app returns
        **note may try to switch to google maps API since openmapquest is giving us some issues with the JSON it              returns
  * figure out an official name
  * figure out if the location issues I'm having with android are limited to my phone
  * possibly return the results/info in a UI element instead of showing notification (maybe?)
  * add twitter functionality?
